drgbl.js
============

Simple Drag &amp; Drop in the browser without a framework

## Example

	var draggableDiv = document.getElementById("someDiv");
	var draggable = new Draggable();
	draggable.makeDraggable(draggableDiv);

[See it working on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/kenturamon/MgEWp/17/)

This is a work in progress, try [this completely different but similarly named project](https://github.com/gtramontina/draggable.js) if you want something that works right now.
